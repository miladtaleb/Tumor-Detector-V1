## Tumor Detection using Deep Learning

This repository contains a deep learning model for detecting tumors in medical images, such as MRI scans. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification and is designed to assist in early detection of abnormalities like brain tumors.

Project Overview

This project implements a Tumor Detection System using deep learning, specifically designed to identify and classify brain tumors in MRI scans. The model is built with a CNN architecture.

The main goal of this project is to develop an automated way for medical professionals to detect tumors early using AI.

Key Features:

    Image classification using CNNs.
    Ability to classify images into tumor/no-tumor categories.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Python 3.10.12
    Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/tumor-detection.git
cd tumor-detection

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Prepare the medical image dataset and place it in the ./data/ folder.

Model Training
Data Preprocessing

The dataset should consist of MRI images, ideally from a publicly available dataset like BraTS. Ensure that the images are correctly labeled for tumor detection (tumor or no_tumor).

To preprocess the dataset:

    Resize images to a uniform shape (224x224 pixels).
    Normalize image pixel values to a range of [0, 1].
